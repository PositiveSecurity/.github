**Who are we?**

We are a team of distributed ledger security researchers who provide smart contract auditing services on Ethereum, TRON, TON, Hyperledger Fabric platforms.

In our audits we use **formal verification** and **fuzzing** methods for deep and comprehensive analysis of code security. We also actively investigate the security of projects with **zero knowledge** and related cryptography.

We run CTF competitions on various platforms that cover not only the challenges of cracking smart contracts, zero disclosure projects (ZKP) and cryptography, but also aim to develop the **formal verification** skills of the community.
